Javascript and Typescript service to deliver unified logs. Works with Winstonjs.

Each log has fixed parts that are separated with a tabulation character `\t`:

```
{timestamp}\t{level}\t{fullMessage}
```

`fullMessage` is a JSON object that has two properties:
- `message` that is the main message of the log
- `data` that is some data about the log (context for instance).

## Install

```bash
npm i @thefirstspine/logs@latest
```
